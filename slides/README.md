In order for ipe to compile figures, ods-figs.sty should be included in your texpath. On my system (Ubuntu), I put it here:

    ~/.texlive2019/texmf-var/tex/latex/ods/ods-figs.sty

I think anywhere under ~/.texlive2019 would work.

I also ran

    texhash ~/.texlive2019

I don't know if that was necessary.
